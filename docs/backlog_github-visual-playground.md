# üéÆ GitHub PR Visual Playground

## Status: üÖøÔ∏è PARKED (Future Enhancement)

### Concept
Enable visual browser sessions in GitHub PRs through commands like:
```
@yofix playground start https://example.com
@yofix playground task "click the login button"
```

### Technical Approach (When Implemented)
1. **Video Recording**: Use Playwright's video recording in headless mode
2. **Screenshot Steps**: Capture screenshots at each action
3. **Artifact Upload**: Store videos/screenshots as GitHub artifacts
4. **PR Comments**: Embed links/previews in PR comments
5. **Session Replay**: Web viewer for recorded sessions

### Challenges
- GitHub Actions runs in headless environment (no display)
- Security concerns with recording sensitive data
- Storage and bandwidth for video artifacts
- Complexity of implementation vs current needs

### Current Alternative
Use local playground for visual debugging:
```bash
node playground.js
```

### Decision
Parked for future requirements. Local playground meets current needs effectively.
