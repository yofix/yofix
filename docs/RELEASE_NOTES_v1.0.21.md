# Release Notes - YoFix v1.0.21

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

### Route Detection Fix
Fixed a critical issue where YoFix was testing incorrect routes based on file paths instead of actual application routes.

#### The Problem
When a component file was changed in a PR, YoFix would generate and test routes based on the file path structure rather than the actual routes that use the component.

**Example:**
- Changed file: `src/pages/members/Testing/Test.tsx`
- **Before (v1.0.20)**: YoFix would test `/members/Testing/Test` (incorrect - based on file path)
- **After (v1.0.21)**: YoFix correctly tests `/debugger` (the actual route that imports this component)

#### The Solution
Updated the route extraction logic in `src/index.ts` to prioritize component-to-route mappings from the RouteImpactAnalyzer. The fix ensures that:

1. Component mappings are checked FIRST
2. Actual route paths are extracted from these mappings
3. File-path-based routes are no longer generated
4. Enhanced logging shows exactly which routes are selected and why

## 📊 Impact

This fix significantly improves the accuracy of visual testing by:
- ✅ Testing only routes that actually exist in the application
- ✅ Eliminating false failures from 404 errors on non-existent routes
- ✅ Ensuring all routes affected by component changes are properly tested
- ✅ Improving performance by not testing invalid routes

## 🔍 Enhanced Debugging

Added detailed logging to help understand route selection:

```
🎯 Component mappings found:
  src/pages/members/Testing/Test.tsx affects 1 routes:
    - /debugger (in src/routes/index.tsx)
📍 Found 1 routes from component mappings
```

## 💻 Technical Details

### Changed Files
- `src/index.ts` - Updated route extraction logic (lines 138-172)

### Key Changes
```typescript
// Extract routes from component mappings FIRST
if (impactTree.componentRouteMapping && impactTree.componentRouteMapping.size > 0) {
  // ... extract actual routes from mappings
}
```

## 🚀 Upgrade Instructions

Update your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- uses: yofix/yofix@v1.0.21

```

## ✅ Verification

After upgrading, verify the fix by:
1. Creating a PR that changes a component file
2. Checking the YoFix logs for component mappings
3. Confirming it tests the correct routes (not file-path-based ones)
