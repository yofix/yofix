# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Shared Browser Session Support**: New `session-mode` input allows reusing browser sessions across route tests
  - `sharedAgent` (default): Authenticates once and reuses session for all routes - 38% faster
  - `independentAgent`: Original behavior with separate sessions per route
  - Significantly improves performance when testing multiple authenticated routes
  - Maintains session state properly between route tests

### Technical Details
- Added `reset()` and `runTask()` methods to Agent class for session reuse
- Modified TestGenerator with `runTestsWithSharedSession()` for efficient testing
- Configurable via `session-mode` input in action.yml

## [1.0.21] - 2025-08-03

### Fixed
- **Critical Route Detection Bug**: Fixed issue where YoFix was testing file-path-based routes instead of actual application routes
  - Component changes now correctly map to their actual routes (e.g., `/debugger` instead of `/members/Testing/Test`)
  - Route extraction logic now prioritizes `componentRouteMapping` from RouteImpactAnalyzer
  - Eliminates 404 errors from testing non-existent routes
  - Improves test accuracy and performance

### Changed
- Enhanced route extraction logging to show which routes are selected and why
- Component mappings are now checked FIRST before any other route sources

### Technical Details
- Updated `src/index.ts` (lines 138-172) to fix route extraction logic
- Routes are now extracted from `impactTree.componentRouteMapping` as the primary source
- File-path-based route generation has been removed from the default behavior

## [1.0.20] - 2025-08-02

### Changed
- Changed default storage-provider from 'auto' to 'firebase'
- Removed 'auto' as a valid storage-provider option for clarity
- Simplified storage provider configuration
- **Optimized build process for GitHub Marketplace**: Single bundled file (5.7MB) with externalized dependencies
- Removed unnecessary CLI files from GitHub Action distribution (CLI available via separate build command)
- Updated package.json files list to only include essential action files

### Fixed
- Fixed loop-frontend CI workflow failures by removing ambiguous 'auto' option
- Storage provider validation now correctly matches action defaults
- Fixed crypto import in CacheManager for proper TypeScript compilation
- Fixed base64 credential parsing in FirebaseStorage initialization

### Added
- Comprehensive test workflow for release preparation
- Storage integration tests for Firebase and S3 providers
- Markdown link checking in CI pipeline
- Separate `build:cli` command for local CLI development

## [1.0.18] - 2025-01-19

### Major Improvements
- üèóÔ∏è **Centralized Architecture**: Complete refactor with centralized utilities, error handling, and configuration management
- üìÅ **File Organization**: Reorganized project structure with proper separation of concerns
- üîß **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive centralized error handling with categorization and recovery
- üíæ **Storage Providers**: Complete Firebase and S3 implementations with batch operations and cleanup

### Added
- New centralized validation patterns and async utilities (`ValidationPatterns`, `AsyncUtilities`)
- Comprehensive error categorization and reporting system
- Storage provider batch operations and console URL generation
- Enhanced configuration management with hierarchical access
- Circuit breaker pattern for reliable operations

- Fixed storage provider interface compliance with missing methods
- Resolved import/export issues after centralized utilities migration
- Fixed test configuration paths and all tests now passing
- Fixed async operation handling in storage provider constructors
- Cleaned up HTML tags in console logs for better readability

### Developer Experience

## [1.0.17] - 2024-08-01

### Added
- Support for custom login URLs with `auth-login-url` parameter
- Persistent authentication session across route tests
- Automatic re-authentication when session expires
- Authentication state saving for debugging
- Improved login form detection with multiple selector strategies

### Changed
- Visual tester now maintains browser context for session persistence
- Route extractor uses tree-sitter AST analysis with regex fallback
- Renamed AINavigationAnalyzer to AIRouteDiscovery for clarity

### Fixed
- Authentication now works with dedicated login pages (e.g., `/login/password`)
- Better error handling and reporting for authentication failures

### Removed
- Removed redundant EnhancedRouteAnalyzer class

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive authentication setup guide
- Added route analysis components reference
- Documented the difference between route-extractor and RouteImpactAnalyzer
