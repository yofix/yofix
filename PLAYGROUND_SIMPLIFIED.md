# 🎮 Playground Simplified!

## What Changed?

The playground has been simplified to remove the redundant `start` command. Now you can execute tasks directly!

## Before (Confusing) ❌
```bash
yofix> start https://app.tryloop.ai
# Wait...
yofix> task go to login page and login
```

## After (Simple) ✅
```bash
yofix> task go to https://app.tryloop.ai, login with user@email.com
# Done! Browser opens and executes everything
```

## How It Works Now

### One Command for Everything
Just use `task` followed by what you want to do:

```bash
# Navigate and interact
task go to google.com and search for "AI news"

# Complex workflows
task go to app.tryloop.ai, click login, enter email hari@tryloop.ai and password Loop@134, then get the user name

# Visual testing
task go to example.com and check for visual issues

# Screenshots
task navigate to github.com and take a screenshot
```

### Smart Input Handling
Even if you forget to type "task", it works:
```bash
yofix> go to google.com and search for cats
💡 Assuming you meant: task go to google.com and search for cats
# Executes the task
```

### Key Benefits

1. **No Session Management** - Each task is self-contained
2. **Natural Language** - Just describe what you want
3. **Fresh Browser** - Each task gets a clean browser instance
4. **Visible Execution** - Watch the AI work in real-time
5. **Reliability Metrics** - See confidence scores after execution

### New Output Format
