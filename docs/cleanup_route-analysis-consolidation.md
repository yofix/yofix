# Route Analysis Consolidation - COMPLETED

## Current State (Redundant Files)

### Core Analyzers
1. **TreeSitterRouteAnalyzer** ✅ (Keep - Core functionality)
   - Uses tree-sitter for accurate AST-based route detection
   - Analyzes TypeScript/JavaScript code structure
   - Most accurate method

2. **RouteImpactAnalyzer** ✅ (Keep - Adds PR context)
   - Uses TreeSitterRouteAnalyzer internally
   - Adds GitHub PR impact analysis
   - Generates route impact trees

### Redundant/Duplicate Files
3. **EnhancedRouteAnalyzer** ❌ (Remove - Duplicates TreeSitterRouteAnalyzer)
   - Just a wrapper around TreeSitterRouteAnalyzer
   - No unique functionality

4. **ComponentRouteMapper** ❌ (Merge into TreeSitterRouteAnalyzer)
   - Functionality already exists in TreeSitterRouteAnalyzer

5. **modules/route-extractor.ts** ❌ (Remove - Inferior approach)
   - Uses Playwright to scrape links from HTML
   - Less accurate than AST analysis
   - Created for modular action but not needed

6. **AINavigationAnalyzer** ⚠️ (Keep but rename)
   - Different purpose - AI-based discovery
   - Complementary to static analysis

## Proposed Structure

```
src/core/analysis/
├── TreeSitterRouteAnalyzer.ts    # Core AST-based route analysis
├── RouteImpactAnalyzer.ts        # PR impact analysis (uses TreeSitter)
└── AIRouteDiscovery.ts           # AI-based route discovery (renamed)

src/modules/
├── route-extractor.ts            # DELETE - Replace with tree-sitter module
├── visual-tester.ts              # Keep
├── screenshot-analyzer.ts        # Keep
└── report-generator.ts           # Keep
```

## Implementation Completed ✅

1. **Updated modules/route-extractor.ts**
   - Now uses tree-sitter for AST-based route extraction
   - Falls back to regex-based extraction if tree-sitter fails
   - Maintains same module interface for backward compatibility

2. **Deleted redundant files**
   - ✅ Removed EnhancedRouteAnalyzer.ts (was unused)
   - ❌ Kept ComponentRouteMapper.ts (used by TreeSitterRouteAnalyzer)

3. **Renamed for clarity**
   - AINavigationAnalyzer.ts → AIRouteDiscovery.ts

4. **Build verified**
   - All compilation errors fixed
   - Project builds successfully

## Benefits
- Single source of truth for route analysis
- More accurate route detection
- Less code to maintain
- Consistent behavior across all YoFix features
